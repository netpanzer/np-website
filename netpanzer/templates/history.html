            <h1>The beginning of NetPanzer</h1>
            <p>"NetPanzer" is a multiplayer tactical war game with an interesting history. Originally developed by Pyrosoft Inc., development of NetPanzer began under that company but stopped in 1999. In 2002 the game was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), becoming free software. This release brought renewed interest, and after being announced on happypenguin.org by Ingo, a group of developers created a Linux port in about two weeks, followed by two more weeks of polishing for the initial release.

                As of 2010, the latest official NetPanzer version was 0.8.3 (released February 20, 2010) and was licensed under GPLv2. The game was also included in volume 2 of "OpenSource Game Power".

                More recently, in 2023, there were discussions about a potential new NetPanzer release featuring significant improvements, new features, and a full code rewrite. The current project status is tracked on the official site, which acts as a landing page for nostalgic players and provides development updates.</p>
